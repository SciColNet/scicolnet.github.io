                <p>Aliakbar Akbaritabar is an incoming Assistant Professor of Computational Social Science at the
University of Rostock and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. He was previously the
Deputy Head for Training at the Department of Digital and Computational Demography at MPIDR and,
before that, a postdoc at the German Centre for Higher Education Research and Science Studies. He holds
a PhD in economic sociology and labour studies from the University of Milan and a PhD in sociology
from the Allameh Tabataba’i University of Tehran. His research focuses on science studies, migration of
researchers and highly skilled populations, social networks, collaboration networks, and computational
social science. He is a member of the core team of the Scholarly Migration Database, which was launched
in 2023. Since 2021, he has been researching the use of bibliometric data for demographic and migration
research at MPIDR. He is an affiliate member of the Robert K. Merton Center for Science Studies at the
Humboldt‑Universität zu Berlin.</p>

                <p><strong>Title of Talk:</strong> "The Multiversatory of science: fostering diversity and inclusion in science by means of multi-perspective and participatory science observatories"</p>
                <p>Rodrigo Costas is a senior researcher at the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University (the Netherlands). Rodrigo is also an Extraordinary Associate Professor at the Centre for Research on Evaluation, Science and Technology (CREST) of Stellenbosch University (South Africa).
				He holds a PhD in Library and Information Science from the CSIC in Spain. His areas of expertise include the fields of information science, scientometrics, and social media metrics. At CWTS he leads the research line in ‘altmetrics’, focused on developing new theoretical and analytical approaches to study
				the interactions between social media and science. Some of his other topics of research include the development of advanced scientometric studies of individual scholars and the study of funding acknowledgments as a new source of scientometric data. In addition to his research activities,
				Rodrigo is also involved in various European and contract research projects.</p>
